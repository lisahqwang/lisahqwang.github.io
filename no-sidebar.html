									<h3><a href="#">The Tragedic Appeal</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
								What makes tragedies so appealing to the public eye? Why does the media primarily focus on tragedies?
								</p>
								<p>
									It is because the public is, and will ever be, immediately attracted to the reality factor of it. 
									They relate tragedies to themselves more often than fortune events, thereby making the visual experience 
									at once more personal. Despite our chase for happiness, the impact of melancholy, the resonance in sadness 
									flows more naturally amongst popular media.
								</p>
								<p>
									There is an impeccable tie between "what could have been" to every tragedy. In Romeo and Juliet, 
									it is the possibility of the couple running off together; In Atonement, it exists in Briony's 
									imagination. Without the machination of the intangible ending, tragedies would not seem so tragic 
									after all. So then, we conclude that tragedies depend on the establishment of that temporal ideal 
									condition, sometime before. If I were to compare life to a movie or a novel, then wouldn't life lean
									toward a tragedy more than anything? 
								</p>
								<p>
									We begin with our kindred and youthful laughs yet conclude with various piercing aches. 
									Better yet, the better your youthfulness was, the more tragic your elderly days will be. 
									The dull will not know the pain of losing joy. So take caution, when you experience surreal 
									triumph and happiness, for an indulgence of such sentiments, will often create a landslide 
									later on.
								</p>
								<p>
									Perhaps this is why we appreciate tragedies so much— it encourages and trumps the dull lives we live.

									<h3><a href="#">On Love</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									When I started reading in English, I picked up the Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. 
									The characters nested in a world of cartoonish reality. Like most books with symbolic characters, 
									it haunts me deeply because the characters have no pluralistic light--- they are so orchestrated 
									that besides their intrinsic representation, that they are saturated of other identifying personalities.
									Again, I didn't understand then that literature can appear in whichever form it demanded to be. Here 
									is my second read of the aviator's prized work, The Little Prince. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I wrestled with the idea of love between the Rose and the Little Prince. "It is the time you have wasted for your rose 
									that makes your rose so important." The prince discovers the sprouting rose, waters her, tends to her with most tender 
									hands. She blossoms under his care, yet her stubbornness and pride, her entitlement and vanity repels him. The love he 
									provides to the rose is not reciprocated, and he leaves his planet to travel afar. He had never been parted with his love
									for her. 
								</p>
								<p>
									In his travels, the prince discovers that his rose is not special--- nor is he. However, Saint-Exupery punctuates that the
									prince had dedicated time and responsibility to the Rose. It is not because she radiates nor because she is perfect, but 
									because of the intertwining fates and opportune moments savoured by both. She loved him, for she withered without his presence.
									Love requires dedication, and so be not afraid of dedication.
								</p>
								<p>
									When the snake (Christ figure) had come to the Prince in the desert (Christ figure x2), the snake tells the Prince that he will
									return home once he is bitten. The little prince knew it was a lie. However, he dearly missed his Rose and went forth to let the
									snake bite him. The suicide (Christ figure x3) was made subtle, but it was apparent upon my second read. Here is a profound mental 
									landscape crafted within an naive framework. I shiver every time I realize how disproportionally this sits upon an innocent platform. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Nonetheless, I'd like to think he is reunited with his Rose, on his small and symbolic planet.

									<h3><a href="#">A small measure of Heaven</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									You live a little, form some small ambitions, construct ideals for the ego, and accept the world. When quietude creeps in at midnight,
									you fright for the empty streets. The hollow, cartoonish happiness that oozes from every walking person is drowning you. When society
									pours its constructs into you, you hide away from these imploding influences. Yet at the crack of dawn, you rise sluggishly to face the
									world again. You dream of days of youth not because you were careless and free, but because you were never truly integrated into society.
									To you, the world does not matter; to the world, you do not exist. 
								</p>
								<p>
									From timid nods to firm handshakes, you progress as the wind blows. After all, you are a crop to be harvested from years of indoctrination. 
									Others may oblige willingly, but you don't. You dream of tearing down the machine, hoping that in the end, it will be you that finds the Achilles'
									heels of this monster— but you never do. Hail philosophers and polymaths alike, they solve society's most mystifying paradoxes. Even they can not 
									fathom the power from your mind's tempest. However, you do not act upon it— no, you remain idle and line up for the next meal. You have considered
									the definition of conscious living, but you withdraw from the ludicrous wonder of the metaphysical. 
								</p>
								<p>
									You think that if you suppress this desire, then you would fit in with society better somehow someday. But someday never came, not when you discover 
									the wrinkles under your eye nor when you realize that the last year has been a blur. Recluses do not measure time as we do, but rather by their generation
									of thoughts to make peace with one's existence. They detest the quantification of living by the amount of time they have left or have spent. You have thought
									about becoming a recluse, and depart from the gushing metropolis at once— but you dread change. You constantly resist the idea of change, but you grow adapted 
									once the change becomes imperative.
								</p>
								<p>
									You do not fear freedom, but you fear the possibility of a better self that has freedom.
								</p>
								<p>
									To you, love is a dainty plaything for the fawning youths. You see more and more of your surroundings fall in love, but you doubt it is a rush of heart 
									more than a rush for completing an obligation. A sentimental creature like you has no fanciful arts in this nature, for you value the abstract more than 
									the concrete. Yet this world has no place for you, you do not categorize into a label. Although it is tantalizing for Atlas to put down the weight of the 
									world, he knows he will be crushed once he does. Such is the paradox of obligation— the narrow path of the given choices often blinds the agent into thinking
									he has none. And so you spend your days pondering for an impossible realm, one that rivals Milton and Goethe.
								</p>
								<p>
									You do breathe some truths when you smile, and— it may be hidden to others— but I will see a flicker of that small measure of heaven in you.

									<h3><a href="#">At the Mountains of Madness</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
								The highly acclaimed H.P. Lovecraft's "At the Mountains of Madness" sits at the intersection of modern horror and science fiction. 
								Readers have to cast aside the straightforward plot and examine the thematic elements. Joyce Carol Oates, upon examining the thematic elements,
								reflected that there is "a grandeur--- a curious elegiac poetry of unspeakable loss, of adolescent despair and existential loneliness". 
								Indeed, genre writers leave a gaping autonomy for the readers to explore motifs. 
								</p>
								<p>
								Lovecraft believes that fear is our deepest and strongest emotion, and cosmic horror is the grandest form of numinous fear. All Lovecraftian horror
								is based on the fundamental premise that common human laws and interests and emotions have no validity or significance in the vast cosmos at large. 
								So, both the narrator and Danforth, in the face of pantheons of monstrous deities at large, can do nothing but run. Lovecraft's descriptive genius
								is demonstrated in front-loading taxonomical identifiers--- it felt like overseeing the Cambrian explosion or Linnaean schema unfolding in these pages. 
								It is a submission to the scientists' gaze: "Early in the boring the sandstone had given place to a vein of Comanchian limestone full of minute fossil
								cephalopods, corals, echini, and spirifera, and with occasional suggestions of ciliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bones." His heavy borrowing of 
								Hellenistic mythology materializes in the use of tentacles, primarily in forms like Azathoth, YogSothoth, Nyarlathotep. Such a composition form emphasizes
								on the idea of primordial chaos, a social response to the inevitability of conflict in the wake of the Second World War. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Chaos is at the beginning of time. 
									<br><br>
									Chaos is a constant state.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Antarctic has long been connotated with the mythic landscape, the subject of the grand polar explorer's interest in the early 19th century. 
									Landscape in literature is symbolic in psyche and culture like the moors of "Wuthering Heights", the crashing seas of "Moby-Dick", and the jungle
									in "Heart of Darkness". The Antarctic's role is to unravel an infinite bleakness to "scientific discovery" and "human progress", ending with all
									crew members either dead or driven insane. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I will now use my favorite scalpel to dissect H.P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft was an elitist, racist, critic of Hitler but adherent to the idea of racial
									hierarchy, and anti-Semite despite marrying a Jew. The Monster is an "Old One", by orders of chronology he proposes a biological hierarchy.
									China Mieville says that "Lovecraft has not so much the steady gaze of objective nihilism as the transmogrifying vision of hysterical nihilism,
									from which his racism is inextricable". The core science of "At the Mountains of Madness" is biology, but its political influences are extremely
									important. Paradoxically, Lovecraft saw the financial collapse of 1929 as "laissez-faire capitalism [being] at the end of its rope" and 
									consequently became a patrician socialist while riding the elitist high horse. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by the idea that "High Cultures"
									pass through cyclic behaviors of birth, development, maturity, slow decline to senescence, decadence, and death. The Old Ones' city has a 
									feature of unhuman gigantism, but all the while still became fallible to decadence.
								</p>
								<p>
									The word, decadence, is mentioned 21 times in this novel. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The monster in "At the Mountains of Madness" represents the elite classes, while the Shoggoths are slaves to the Old Ones and bred to carry out labor.
									The Shoggoths revolt, which Lovecraft writes extensively about their inferiority and loathsome behavior--- because they are the masses. Lovecraft loathes 
									Bolshevism: the masses are heterogenous and "shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles". The Shoggoth is fashioned out of the distrust for the masses
									, the working class, eventually quelled to be repeating and mimicking the Old Ones. Therefore, Lovecraft operates on the sentiment that there is a
									visceral mistrust of and antipathy for the masses. He is merciless--- Shoggoths are described to be reproducing by fission and are dangerous upon 
									acquiring accidental intelligence.
								</p>
								<p>
									Acquiring accidental intelligence would be a perturbation in the system. 
									<br>
									Perhaps the true horror that Lovecraft wishes to convey is that there is nothing more terrifying than an upheaval of the social order. 
								</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Ode to Psyche</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I had studied Keats' most famous odes. While the other ones are more well-known, I enjoyed "Ode to Psyche" the most.
									In his time, Walt Whitman and Lord Byron were the prime naturalist poets. This poem has the most natural element in it.
									To convey a distinct Keatsian style, Keats merged both mythology and imagination. As we know, Psyche is the Greek goddess who was immortalized 
									by her symbol of love for Eros, the god of love. Through turbulent tasks and many of Aphrodite's trials, Psyche prevails. On the other hand, 
									the psyche means the human mind and consciousness. Many have commented on how this poem reminds them of a dream-like state. This can be attributed 
									to how Keats is "looking" at Psyche and Eros from a distance, therefore creating this illusion of being at once present and not present. 
								</p>
								<p>
									In this poem, Keats captures the ethereal state of innocence; however, Keats is listed amongst poets in the romantic era for the ode’s sensuality. 
									A form of a sonnet with no rhyme scheme but a bountiful amount of visual imagery Keats follows. Psyche, the neglected goddess without shrines or
									followers to call her own, was illustrated in blended colors by Keats. Indeed–– who shine brilliantly shines without shrines, without hymns, 
									without choir. During the final stanza, the melancholy and nostalgia is particularly poignant. Keats ends with his hope to renew love to sweep away 
									Psyche’s forgotten state; thus, he embraces Psyche for her duality. Employing shadows in the last frame shows the duality of Psyche: both light to
									represent remembrance and dark to represent oblivion. Revealing the mythical world through Keatsian language is Keats’ ultimate purpose. Both the 
									abundance of flowers and the fertility of the forest in "Ode to Psyche" hint at the beauty of innocence, of love, and of serenity.

									<h3><a href="#">On Fear</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Being afraid is a socially-learned behavior. In saying this, I am not desensitizing fear or the state of high distress. However, I am stating that,
									it is within human nature to socialize and thereby inherit certain fears. By the same token, doesn't that mean that I can train myself to be afraid? 
								</p>
								<p>
									For example, I am deathly afraid of snakes.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here are some questions I ask myself: 
									<li>Fear & exposure--- If I so choose to go to the snake exhibit of the zoo everyday, does the constant exposure of snakes aggravate or conciliate my fear?</li>
									<li>Fear & association --- If I analyze the harm of snakes (killing me by poison, or worse, biting my ankle off and bringing me great hospital bills) and rationalize it (I live in the city). Does rationalization disassociate me from this fear?</li>
									<li>Fear & society --- I know a lot of the fears are common (fear of spiders, heights) amongst population. If I had the absurd ability to change society's common fears, such as to fear eucalyptus trees and to love snakes, will I still be deathly afraid of snakes?</li>
